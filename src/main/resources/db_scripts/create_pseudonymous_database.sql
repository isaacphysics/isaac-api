-- TO USE THIS SCRIPT

-- Create the new schema with the anonymised data in it:
--     SELECT create_anonymous_database();

-- Dump the data to file:
--     docker exec -i postgres-live pg_dump --username=rutherford --data-only -n anonymous | gzip > anonymousdb.sql.gz

-- Create a blank Isaac database as usual.

-- Change the name of the schema so that the data gets loaded into the blank Isaac database:
--     ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO anonymous;

-- Load the data into the new database:
--     gunzip -c anonymousdb.sql.gz | docker exec -i postgres-anon psql -U rutherford -f -

-- Rename the schema back to the default value so that the API can connect to it:
--     ALTER SCHEMA anonymous RENAME TO public;

-- Set sequences to correct values so that database can be used:
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.assignments_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.assignments;
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.event_bookings_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.event_bookings;
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.groups_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.groups;
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.ip_location_history_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.ip_location_history;
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.logged_events_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.logged_events;
--     SELECT SETVAL('public.question_attempts_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.question_attempts;

--     SELECT SETVAL('public.users_id_seq', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1) ) FROM public.users;

-- To allow admins to login, add a 2FA secret to those accounts:
